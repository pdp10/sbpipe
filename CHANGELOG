### CHANGELOG

v4.4.0 (devel)

- Replaced INI configuration files with YAML configuration files.
- Skip heatmap and multiple time course plot if only one simulation is run. These plots are just redundant.
- removed support for running R, Octave, and Java models directly as these can be run via a Python model wrapper.
- bug fixes

v3.0.0 (Earth)

- added prints to r plotting functions
- pipeline analyses are executed on cluster (local, sge, lsf) using sbpipe parcomp module.
- renamed option `pp_cpus` to `local_cpus`, after removal of parallel python.
- renamed value `pp` to `local` for option `cluster` after removal of parallel python.
- added support for Python 3. The code is now expected to work for Python 2.7+, 3.2, and 3.6.
- replaced parallel python with python multiprocessing package. This should facilitate the transition to Python 3.
- removed deprecated source code for manually randomising parameters before parameter estimation in Copasi files.
- Copasi and PL-based simulators now share a large amount of code.
- adapted programming language-based simulators to use ps1 and ps2 post-processing code. All simulators support all the pipelines.
- moved post-processing code for ps1 and ps2 from Copasi to Simul.
- improved code cohesion by moving utility code into Simul class().
- improved output name consistency for report and plot files
- improved sorting of plots in latex/pdf report for ps1 pipeline
- added test case for stochastic double parameter scan.
- double parameter scans can be executed in parallel as repeats.
- added support for stochastic double parameter scans.

- single parameter scans can be executed in parallel as repeats.
- added support for stochastic single parameter scans.
- modularised parallel computation within Copasi simulator
- added heatmap plot representing stochastic repeats for the time course simulation.
- moved R code from pipelines to R/
- redesign of simulation plots. Improvements plus based on melt function.

- improved reuse for all R plots.
- added plots reproducing all the single simulations per species.
- changed main script name from run_sbpipe.py to sbpipe.py.
- Added support for parameter estimation using non-Copasi models. Test using R model.
- Skip Java, Python, and R model tests if their dependencies are not satisfied.
- Optimised Java, Python, and R simulators. Report file names are passed as input argument. Models do not need to be replicated.
- Java models can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.
- Python models can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.
- R models can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.
