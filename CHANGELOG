### CHANGELOG

v2.14.0 (devel)

- added heatmap plot representing stochastic repeats for the time course simulation.
- moved R code from pipelines to R/
- redesign of simulation plots. Improvements plus based on melt function.
- removed remaining old gplots dependent code. Sbpipe only uses ggplot2 now.
- added two new plots useful for stochastic simulation
- improved reuse for all R plots.
- added plots reproducing all the single simulations per species.
- changed main script name from run_sbpipe.py to sbpipe.py.
- Added support for parameter estimation using non-Copasi models. Test using R model.
- Skip Java, Python, and R model tests if their dependencies are not satisfied.
- Optimised Java, Python, and R simulators. Report file names are passed as input argument. Models do not need to be replicated.
- Java models can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.
- Python models can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.
- R models can be used for model simulation in addition to Copasi.


v2.0.0 (Venus)

- improved threshold levels for Sampled PLE plots.
- added 20 tests including wrong configuration file settings.
- extensive refactory of unit tests.
- source code uses PEP8 standard
- source code cleaning and reformatting.
- improved source code by eliminating some warning highlighted by PyCharm.
- moved script core functions within sbpipe package.
- the copasi package is now a dynamically loaded simulator. Users can choose the simulator
to use in the configuration file.
- simulators are loaded dynamically. Uncoupling between simulators and pipelines.
- separation of code for generating data from pipeline package. 
- improved source code modularisation for the whole program.
- extracted scripts (run_sbpipe and cleanup_sbpipe) from sbpipe/.

- all Python imports are now absolute (in agreement with Python 3). 
- improvements to program prints
- project renamed sbpipe
- added AIC, AICc, BIC to the parameter estimation summary table.
- randomisation of initial parameter values for parameter estimation is now only
performed by Copasi.
- added plots comparing model simulation vs experimental data in simulate pipeline.
- improving plot margins for simulate and single parameter scan pipelines.
- source code refractoring in parameter estimation analysis task.
- fixed a bug in parameter estimation pipeline related to the filtering of confidence
intervals from the complete data set.
- added ratios in parameter estimation summaries to investigate the distance between the
estimated parameter and its confidence intervals.
- plot polishing.
- separated options for plotting 2d correlations within 66%, 95%, or 99% confidence intervals.
- added 99% confidence intervals parameter estimation plots. 
- added option to plot parameter estimation plots using the scientific notation.
- improved plots layout (fonts, legends).
- added option for y axis label to simulate and single parameter scan pipelines.
- Copasi models are fully consistent.
- table of estimated parameter and confidence values is in normal scale (not log10).
